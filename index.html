          Hi, my name is Fernando. I built my first computer in middle school after being introduced to hardware and software at a young age by a CNC programmer (who was my grandfather). 
          My passion for tech and programming has kept growing after building my first computer.
          <br>
          Now a days I am striving to gain as much expierence as possible but would love to find my self working in IT audit, PCI compliance, as a cybersecurity analyst (managing a SIEM), cloud security, network security, and/or system administration
          <br>
          I am willing to start my IT career from the bottom and work my way up.

        <h3>Pokemon App Version 2</h3>
        
        <hr />
        <p>
          For this React app I used hooks to fetch Api information,
          I also added a simple graph and images all from the pokemon API.
          I wish I could have added an authentication portal and another graph that would calculate an overall score for the pokemon., calculated from variables from the api of course.

        <h3>Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Picture App</h3>
        
        <hr />
        <p>
          This React app was just like the Pokemon app, I pulled data from the API and changed it to string to see what data I could work with. 

          <br>
          I was thinking about going back to this app and adding a graphic giving an overall score for the card and better grahpic user interface.

        <h3>Simple Membership App</h3>
        
        <hr />
        <p>
          I used firebase to do the backend authentication process. This app is very simple but it works! In version 2 it would be awesome to add router to it in order to display membership content in the same and different pages.

          This is another Javascript React App I made pulling in data from an API, then using React to display. In version 2 I wish to make it be part of a forex app.
